This is a data set based on Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset (see http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

Based on raw data set, we do following process:
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The dataset includes the following files:
=========================================

- 'README.txt'

- 'cookbook': List of all variables.

- 'data/aggData.txt':  tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.


Notes: 
======
- Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].
- Each feature vector is a row on the text file.
